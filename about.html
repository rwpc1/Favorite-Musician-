      <h2>About</h2>
      <h3>Hip-Hop Bio:</h3>
      <p>
        Pop Smoke, was an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. He was
        considered by many to be the face of Brooklyn drill. Born and raised in
        Canarsie, Brooklyn, Pop Smoke began his musical career in late 2018 with
        his debut single &quot;Mpr (Panic Part 3 Remix)&quot;. Pop Smoke rose to
        fame with the release of his breakout singles &quot;Welcome to the
        Party&quot; and &quot;Dior&quot; in 2019. He often collaborated with UK
        drill artists and producers, who employed more minimal and aggressive
        instrumentation than drill artists from Chicago.

        Following his rise to fame, Rico Beats introduced Pop Smoke to Steven
        Victor in April 2019. Victor would later have Pop Smoke sign a recording
        contract with Victor Victor Worldwide and Republic Records. He released
        his debut mixtape Meet the Woo in July 2019. His second mixtape, Meet
        the Woo 2, was released on February 7, 2020, and debuted at number seven
        on the Billboard 200, becoming the rapper&#39;s first top-10 project in
        the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        Less than two weeks after the release of the mixtape, Pop Smoke was
        murdered during a home invasion in Los Angeles. Fellow New York rapper
        50 Cent was the executive-producer of his posthumous debut studio album,
        Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon, released on July 3, 2020. The
        album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and all 19 tracks from
        the album charted on the Billboard Hot 100. The album also spawned a
        string of international top-10 singles, including &quot;For the
        Night&quot; (featuring DaBaby and Lil Baby) and &quot;What You Know Bout
        Love&quot;.
      </p>
      <h3>Early Life</h3>
      <p>
        Bashar Barakah Jackson was born on July 20, 1999, in Brooklyn, New York,
        to a Panamanian mother, Audrey Jackson, and a Jamaican father, Greg
        Jackson. He had an older brother named Obasi. Jackson attended nine
        different schools while growing up in Canarsie, Brooklyn. He played the
        African drums in his local church as a child. Jackson was expelled from
        eighth grade for bringing a gun to school and spent two years on house
        arrest after being charged with possessing a weapon. Jackson started
        playing basketball as a point and shooting guard. He relocated to
        Philadelphia to enroll in Rocktop Academy. He was later forced to leave
        after being diagnosed with a heart murmur. Jackson later turned to
        street life.
      </p>
      <h3>Music Career</h3>
      <p>
        In a Genius interview, he stated that his artist name of Pop Smoke is a
        combination of Poppa, a name given to him by his Panamanian grandmother,
        and Smocco Guwop, a nickname from childhood friends. He began his music
        career in 2018 when visiting a Brooklyn recording studio with fellow
        rapper Jay Gwuapo. After Gwuapo got high on drugs, he fell asleep. Pop
        Smoke went into the booth to try rapping for the first time, just to see
        if he could do it. He used a beat he got from 808Melo&#39;s YouTube
        channel and recorded his track titled &quot;Mpr (Panic Part 3
        Remix)&quot;. On January 28, 2019, he released &quot;Flexin&#39;&quot;.
        Meanwhile, Pop Smoke befriended producer Rico Beats, who was acquainted
        with record executive Steven Victor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The three set up an interview, and in April 2019, Pop Smoke signed to
        Victor Victor Worldwide, a subsidiary of Universal Music. On April 23,
        2019, Pop Smoke released his breakout single, &quot;Welcome to the
        Party&quot;, that was produced by 808Melo. Two remixes of the song were
        later recorded, with one featuring Nicki Minaj and the other featuring
        Skepta. Pop Smoke released his debut mixtape Meet the Woo on July 26,
        2019. From October to December 2019, Pop Smoke would release a plethora
        of singles, including &quot;War&quot; with Lil Tjay, and &quot;100k on a
        Coupe&quot; with Calboy. On December 27, 2019, Pop Smoke appeared on
        Travis Scott&#39;s Cactus Jack Records compilation album JackBoys on the
        song &quot;Gatti&quot; which was also accompanied by a music video.
        &quot;Gatti&quot; debuted and peaked at number 69 on the US Billboard
        Hot 100, giving Pop Smoke his first Hot 100 appearance. On January 16,
        2020, Pop Smoke released &quot;Christopher Walking&quot;. On February 7,
        2020, Pop Smoke released his second mixtape Meet the Woo 2, with
        features from Quavo, A Boogie wit da Hoodie, Fivio Foreign and Lil Tjay.
        The mixtape debuted at number seven on the US Billboard 200, earning Pop
        Smoke his first top-10 hit in the United States. Five days after its
        release, a deluxe edition was released with three new songs, each
        featuring a guest appearance, consisting of Nav, Gunna, and PnB Rock.
        Pop Smoke teased to social media his debut headlining concert tour Meet
        the Woo Tour to promote both his mixtapes. The tour was planned to begin
        in the US in March, and end in the UK in April.
      </p>
      <h3>Posthumous releases</h3>
      <p>
        &quot;Dior&quot;, the second single off Meet the Woo, became Pop
        Smoke&#39;s first posthumous solo hit, peaking at number 22 on the
        Billboard Hot 100 and number 33 on the UK Singles Chart. At the
        beginning of March 2020, American rapper 50 Cent announced on his
        Instagram that he had decided to executive produce and finish Pop
        Smoke&#39;s debut studio album. After his announcement, 50 Cent called
        artists like Roddy Ricch, Drake, and Chris Brown wanting to feature them
        on the record. Pop Smoke had wanted to take his mother to an awards show
        prompting 50 Cent to promise to take her to one when the album was
        complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        On April 16, 2020, a documentary on Pop Smoke&#39;s life was announced
        to be in the works. On May 14, 2020, Victor announced that Pop
        Smoke&#39;s debut studio album would be posthumously released on June
        12, 2020. The album would be known as Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the
        Moon. It was originally set for release on June 12, 2020, but was pushed
        back out of respect for the George Floyd protests. Instead, on the
        album&#39;s original release date, the lead single, &quot;Make It
        Rain&quot;, featuring fellow Brooklyn rapper Rowdy Rebel was released.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rebel&#39;s verse was recorded through a collect call since he was
        incarcerated at the time. Virgil Abloh created the album&#39;s original
        artwork. The cover artwork provoked significant criticism from fans who
        called it &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;rushed&quot; and felt it was
        disrespectful. It prompted a Change.org petition attracting tens of
        thousands of signatures. Ryder Ripps created the final cover art with
        the chrome rose against a black background. Pop Smoke&#39;s mother chose
        the final album cover hours before the album was released commercially.
      </p>
      <p>
        The album was officially released on July 3, 2020, to commercial
        success, reaching number one in several countries, including on the
        Billboard 200. All 19 songs on the album charted on the Billboard Hot
        100, with &quot;For the Night&quot; featuring Lil Baby and DaBaby,
        debuting and peaking at number six, giving Pop Smoke his first top-10
        hit in the US. On July 20, 2020, on what would have been Pop Smoke&#39;s
        21st birthday, a deluxe edition of the album was released, and featured
        15 new additional tracks.The album&#39;s fifth single &quot;What You
        Know Bout Love&quot;, would later end up peaking at number nine on the
        Billboard Hot 100, giving Pop Smoke his second top-10 hit in the US. On
        February 26, 2021, &quot;AP&quot; was released as the lead single for
        the Boogie soundtrack. Pop Smoke was cast as Monk in a minor role for
        Boogie.
      </p>
      <p>
        A second posthumous album titled FAITH is set to be released on July 16,
        2021.
      </p>
      <h3>Death and Legacy</h3>
      <p>
        On February 19, 2020, Pop Smoke was renting a house owned by The Real
        Housewives star Teddi Mellencamp and her husband, Edwin Arroyave, in
        Hollywood Hills, California. At around 4:30 a.m., four hooded men,
        including one wearing a ski mask and carrying a handgun, broke into the
        house. The LAPD received news of the home invasion from a call from the
        East Coast. Police arrived at the home six minutes later and found Pop
        Smoke with multiple gunshot wounds. He was rushed to Cedars-Sinai
        Medical Center, where doctors performed a thoracotomy on the left side
        of his chest. A few hours later, he was pronounced dead at the age of 20
        years old.
      </p>
      <p>
        On February 21, the Los Angeles County Department of Medical
        Examiner-Coroner revealed that the cause of Pop Smoke&#39;s death was a
        gunshot wound to the torso. Investigators believed that the house was a
        target for home invasions following a string of robberies that took
        place at homes rented by musicians. The LAPD at first considered that
        Pop Smoke&#39;s death was gang-related as he was tied to the Crips. It
        also suspected that his killers may have been gang-affiliated. The LAPD
        later believed his death was the consequence of a home robbery gone
        wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        The day before his murder, Pop Smoke and friend Michael Durodola had
        posted several images on social media, including one in which
        Mellencamp&#39;s home address can be seen in the background. The rapper
        also posted a story on Instagram and Facebook of gifts he had received.
        One showed the house&#39;s full address on the packaging, giving out its
        location.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pop Smoke&#39;s body was originally planned to be buried at the Cypress
        Hills Cemetery but was later changed to Green-Wood Cemetery. Family,
        friends, and fans of Pop Smoke gathered in his hometown of Canarsie,
        Brooklyn, to show their respects. His casket was pulled in a horse-drawn
        carriage and was surrounded by glass windows and white curtains.
      </p>
      <p>
        On July 9, 2020, three adult men and two minors were arrested for the
        murder of the rapper. Pop Smoke&#39;s suspected killers were identified
        as Corey Walker, 19; Keandre D. Rodgers, 18; Jaquan Murphy, 21, and two
        unnamed juveniles who were ages 15 and 17 at the time of the killing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Walker and Rodgers were each charged with murder with a special
        circumstance that alleged the killing was committed &quot;during the
        commission of a robbery and a burglary&quot;. A judge later determined
        that Rodgers was still a minor at the time of Pop Smoke&#39;s murder.
        Walker is being defended by defense attorney Christopher Darden, a
        former prosecutor from the O. J. Simpson murder case. After Walker
        refused any more delays in his case, witnesses were due to testify at a
        preliminary hearing in March 2021. Walker is eligible for the death
        penalty or life without parole if convicted on the murder charge. The
        two juveniles had also been charged with murder and robbery in juvenile
        court. Murphy was later charged with attempted murder. With the election
        of George Gascón in November 2020, the death penalty will not be pursued
        due to Gascón&#39;s pledge to never seek a death sentence. The juveniles
        were never eligible for the death penalty since California law has
        prohibited death as a legal sentence for juveniles along with the
        Supreme Court case Roper v. Simmons prohibiting the use of the death
        penalty for those under 18 years of age.
      </p>
      <p>
        In May 2021, new details emerged that Pop Smoke was taking a shower at a
        home rented through Airbnb when masked men entered the home through a
        second-story balcony. A woman who was staying with Pop Smoke at the time
        in the house had a gun held to her head, and one of the intruders
        threatened to kill her, saying, &quot;Shut the fuck up. Do you want to
        die?&quot; The woman heard Pop Smoke struggle in the shower and then
        heard him screaming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pop Smoke ran out of the bathroom and then the woman heard a loud bang
        and heard Pop Smoke fall to the ground. Two other intruders began to
        kick him. Pop Smoke was able to get up and run downstairs, but not
        before the woman heard two more gunshots. She followed Pop Smoke to see
        him on the ground and screamed for Michael Durodola to call 911. It was
        believed the intruders stole Pop Smoke&#39;s gold watch and other
        jewelry before running away from the house.
      </p>
      <p>
        In May 2020, the 15-year-old, the youngest of the four intruders,
        allegedly admitted to killing Pop Smoke over a diamond-studded Rolex
        during a recorded interview with a cellmate at a juvenile detention
        center. The 15-year-old told the cellmate that Pop Smoke at first
        complied with their requests for jewelry but then tried to fight them,
        and a confrontation broke out in which Pop Smoke was pistol-whipped and
        shot with a Beretta M9. The intruders made off with his Rolex, which
        they sold for only $2,000.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pop Smoke&#39;s parents, Audrey and Greg Jackson shared memories of
        their son before saying how gun violence took him away from them.
      </p>
      <p>
        On February 19th, at 4:00 AM, a gun was used to take my son from me. You
        know him as Pop Smoke, we called him &#39;Shar&#39;. Because of gun
        violence, I&#39;ll never see my son run up the front of our steps,
        taking them two at a time; he won&#39;t ever take my hands again and
        dance with me; he won&#39;t come into my room and muscle pose in the
        mirror. Gun violence destroys families. It must stop.
      </p>
      <p>
        — Audrey Jackson during an ad for the &quot;Gun Violence Destroys
        Families&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Danny Schwartz wrote in The Ringer that &quot;[Pop Smoke] conquered New
        York rap and gave the city the kind of readymade and potentially
        defining star it hadn&#39;t seen in years&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pop Smoke&#39;s work ethic was widely praised by his peers in the music
        industry. Executive producer of his posthumous album 50 Cent revealed
        Smoke was always &quot;writing what [50] said down&quot; on his
        telephone, while Quavo added he &quot;felt like [he] was talking to
        somebody that had been in the game for three years already&quot;.
        Because of Smoke&#39;s strong desire to leave his old lifestyle, he
        motivated young people of his neighbourhood to get away from the
        streets. Producer Rico Beats explained Smoke started &quot;telling kids,
        don&#39;t go the gang route&quot;, wanting to &quot;be a better
        person&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few months after his death, his family announced the creation of Shoot
        for the Stars, a foundation launched by Pop Smoke which aims to help and
        inspire inner-city youth with a platform that helps to achieve goals
        amidst living and growing up in difficult circumstances. After his
        death, several murals of him were created in Canarsie. Although his
        lyrics do not generally contend with police brutality or racism, his
        songs, particularly &quot;Dior&quot;, were popularly used during the
        George Floyd protests in New York City as a symbol of resistance.
